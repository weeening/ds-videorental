This is a video rental system (Console application) I did for TDS 2111 Data Structures and Algorithms written in C++ using CodeBlocks 
Database is just a textfile which is editable. 

The irony of the name is fully intended.

Note to those who wish to use this as a reference: 
Explore other options than CodeBlocks. By the time I finished coding I regretted not trying other IDEs because support for C++ 11 was limited at the point of coding about mid 2017 (WHAT).
